      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Brown Co-op is one of Princeton's student-run food cooperatives - an alternative to dining halls and eating clubs for upperclassmen. In 2015, I worked in a team of two on Brown's website redesign. Brown had used the same website since 2013 and was looking for a refresh in time for its next member recruitment period.</p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>We began by holding a kickoff meeting with Brown's co-presidents and webmaster to discuss their vision, priorities, and constraints for the site redesign - and to start co-creating. From this discussion, we were able to define our success criteria for the new site:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Give prospective members a "taste" of Brown</span> - A key visitor segment for the site would be students thinking of joining the co-op. How could the website be a vehicle for Brown to showcase its personality and share relevant information? We discussed how various design choices (e.g., sticking to a warm autumn color palette) and content elements (e.g., recipe cards, member photos) could convey the cozy (and delicious) experience of being a part of Brown.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Streamline the recruitment process</span> - With the spring lottery coming up, Brown was hoping prospective members could express interest in joining the co-op through the site.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Easy to update</span> - The team valued that the existing site was easy for anyone to update, so we agreed that this would be the case for the redesign too.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One question that came up was whether to develop a static or dynamic site; we ultimately settled on the former. While the idea of adding a blog to Brown's site was exciting, it would require changing the site's hosting situation, which would involve a longer timeframe.</p>
      <p>With our objectives in mind, my project partner Jenny and I got to work. We worked simultaneously and in close collaboration - from sketching out and exchanging wireframes for the site's pages, to writing lines of HTML/CSS that actualized our vision. Jenny introduced me to Bootstrap's rich library, which I became familiar with over the course of the project as we selected components of the framework that could expedite our process.</p>
      <p>After developing an initial "proof of concept" version of the site, we shared our work with the Brown team so that we could iterate together. The team provided thoughtful feedback on certain content elements (e.g., FAQ page for prospective members) that could be featured more prominently, as well as additional areas to incorporate the co-op logo.</p>
      <h2>Results &amp; Reflections</h2>
      <p>Following some brief QA/bug testing, the new site went live in time for Brown's member recruitment period. The site was well-received by Brown's officer team and the other co-op members - and continues to be used and updated today.</p>
