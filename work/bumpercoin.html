          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p class="f1">Bumpercoin is a startup that connects drivers with unused bumper space to local businesses and charities looking for a new advertising channel. I created a series of illustrations to help Bumpercoin communicate its benefits to prospective drivers and advertisers, as well as further define its brand identity.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Bumpercoin's website had dedicated pages for drivers and businesses/charities, which laid out the value proposition for signing up through a mix of text and stock imagery. The company's founder wanted to replace the stock photos with something that was more tailored to Bumpercoin's product and brand. After learning more about what Bumpercoin hoped to achieve through this refresh, we set out to create a series of illustrations that would speak to the startup's many audiences - meaning it would be professional yet fun, simple yet innovative.</p>
          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>I began the project by understanding the brand identity that Bumpercoin wanted to cultivate - how would the company want to be described? In doing so, I realized that I would need to develop an illustration style that could balance how Bumpercoin wanted drivers to see them - fun, easy, and clever - with the image it wanted to provide businesses - innovative, good value, and reputable.</p>
          <p>With these principles in mind, the first phase of the project focused on figuring out the best way to convey the concepts that were described in Bumpercoin's marketing material. Thinking through how to illustrate concepts like ease, passive income, and customization in a way that was unique to Bumpercoin was a fun challenge. By beginning with pen and paper, I was able to rapidly iterate with the Bumpercoin team. I explored multiple ideas and metaphors in search of what resonated most.</p>
          <img src="../images/bc_sketches.jpg">
          <p>Once we landed on a series of concepts we were excited about, I moved onto defining the visual language of these illustrations, including color choices, level of detail, and level of abstraction vs. realism. Through ongoing feedback, we were able to converge on a palette and aesthetic that the team felt was expressive of Bumpercoin. From there, I further finessed the illustrations to get them ready for 'publication.'</p>
