      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Early on in my time at Deloitte, I was lucky enough to get in touch with a group of people within the firm who saw an opportunity to bring design thinking to the public and social sectors. We believed that human-centered design could help our clients become better innovators and deliver more effectively on their missions. During my two years at the firm, I worked on several projects oriented around that thesis - and in turn, dove headfirst into the full design research process, from planning ethnographic studies to co-creating solutions alongside clients. I also played a role in building our firm's customer strategy client offering, which included developing our firm's methodologies and supporting business development efforts.</p>
      <h2>What I worked on</h2>
      <p>I can't share all the details from my client projects, but below is a sample of the types of business questions I tackled as a consultant / researcher and some things I learned along the way.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">How can we improve the self-service experience in our retail stores, so that consumers are willing and excited to transact this way?</span> Our team explored this question through 60 user interviews conducted in stores across the country. What emerged were a series of patterns and insights around why some users shied away from self-service even though it could save them time. We dug into the fears and concerns that inhibited the use of self-service and used this as a basis for mocking up a reimagined self-service experience.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">How can we redesign the service experience for our SMB customers in order to reduce churn?</span> Our team began our inquiry by spending time alongside our client's SMB customers - observing them as they went about their day-to-day operations. I developed the research plan for this ethnographic study and joined our team on the road. After our research was complete, we synthesized our learnings into a series of user journey maps, which we socialized across the client organization in order to develop a unified roadmap for CX improvements.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">How can we motivate and support participants in our innovation challenge, so that they are inspired to take part and able to produce the best ideas?</span> To facilitate discussion around this topic, I created a journey map that depicted the activities and emotions of  participants at each phase. This sparked rich conversations with the client team around how we could better engage participants at key touchpoints in their journey.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">What could we offer to support organizations navigating a major transition in leadership?</span> Working in a team of two, I conducted user interviews with current and past employees who had been through such a transition. By identifying their common needs and pain points, we were able to devise a set of potential solutions to bring to market against this business challenge.</li>
