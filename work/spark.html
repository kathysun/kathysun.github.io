          <p class="f1">We all have goals we want to achieve, but life can get in the way - or we can get discouraged. Spark is an app concept that I developed with two classmates for a UX Design course at UC Berkeley Extension. Through empathy, ideation, and several rounds of user testing, we designed an experience to help people stay motivated with their goals through emphasizing 'micro-progress' and small wins.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The inspiration from Spark came from a problem we'd all faced - having goals that were important to us but had fallen by the wayside. We knew we weren't alone; we learned that <a href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/science-says-92-percent-of-people-dont-achieve-goals-heres-how-the-other-8-perce.html" target="_blank">92% of people abandon their New Year's resolutions</a>. Reasons included competing priorities taking over, feeling discouraged by the complexity of the task ahead, or simply losing motivation.</p>
          <p>With Spark, we wanted to solve for these obstacles. Our goal was to improve the experience of making progress on your goals so that users could achieve more of what they wanted in life.</p>
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>Our design process for Spark involved several key phases, from defining the problem and understanding our target users, to diverging and converging on ideas for how to solve our users' problems, to developing prototypes that grew in fidelity as we learned more through user testing. Within our team, my key contributions included defining our context scenario, as well as creatng the UI and flow/interactions for both our prototypes and final solution.</p>
          <h3>Understanding our target users</h3>
          <p>Before beginning ideation, we wanted to really understand our target users - what they are trying to accomplish in their lives, and the types of experiences they would find rewarding.</p>
          <p>Our persona, Jacob, became the focal point for our discussions around what we wanted to build. Jacob is a 35-year-old digital native who works full-time at a bank. He wants to transition into UX design (keeping with the topic of the class), but his day job and other responsibilities keep him busy.</p>
          <p>Combined with our project objectives, creating this persona helped us formulate a set of <span class="b">design principles</span> for Spark (the app that 'ignites' your goals):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="b">Focus on 'micro-progress'</span> - From our conversations and review of the <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins" target="_blank">latest research</a>, we knew that consistently setting and achieving small goals increased motivation. Micro-goals also fit well with the time constraints our target users faced.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Provide just-in-time nudges</span> - We envisioned our app as a gentle 'tap on your shoulder' that would re-surface your long-term goals during opportune moments - so they wouldn't get buried in the day-to-day grind.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Automate as much as possible</span> - We heard that goal tracking apps too often felt like 'overhead,' and that this tedium led to abandonment. We wanted Spark to instead feel more like an 'intelligent assistant' who made it easier to work on your goals.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Jacob also became the protagonist of a <span class="b">context scenario</span> I developed, which illustrated how Spark's 'micro-progress' experience could fit into our target users' daily lives and give users a boost when working on their goals gets tough.</p>

          <h3>Key insights from user testing</h3>
            <p>Based on our problem statement and design principles, our team brainstormed dozens of ideas for how we could improve the experience of making progress on your goals. We eventually chose to <span class="b">prioritize building out the experience of working on a 'micro-goal'</span> - an activity that supports your larger goal, but is small enough so that you can squeeze it into your day - as we felt it was the most essential task users would complete with Spark.</p>
            <p>We then created a prototype focused on this user task, which began with a notification from Spark's chatbot on Facebook Messenger and ended with the user completing his/her 'micro-goal' for the day. Through testing our prototype with 5 users, we were able to gather several valuable insights and rapidly iterate on our design.</p>
