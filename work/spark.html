          <p class="f1">We all have goals we want to achieve, but life can get in the way - or we can get discouraged. Spark is a conceptual app that I developed with two classmates for a UX Design course at Berkeley Extension. Through research, ideation, several rounds of user testing, we designed an experience that uses the power of 'micro-progress' to help people stay motivated with their goals.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The inspiration for Spark came from a problem we'd all faced - having goals that were important to us but had fallen by the wayside. Our research showed we weren't alone; <a href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/science-says-92-percent-of-people-dont-achieve-goals-heres-how-the-other-8-perce.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92% of people abandon their New Year's resolutions</a>. Reasons included competing priorities taking over, feeling discouraged by the complexity of the task ahead, or simply losing motivation.</p>
          <p>With Spark, our goal was to improve the experience of making progress on your goals, so that users could overcome these challenges and achieve more of what they wanted in life.</p>
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>Our team worked in close collaboration throughout the project. Within our team, I was in charge of developing our storyboard, as well as defining our app's UI and flow/interactions.</p>
          <h3>Understanding our target users</h3>
          <p>Before beginning ideation, we wanted to really understand our target users - what they are trying to accomplish in their lives, and the types of experiences they would find rewarding.</p>
          <p>Our persona, Jacob, became the focal point for our discussions around what we wanted to build. Jacob is a 35-year-old digital native who works full-time at a bank. He wants to transition into UX design (keeping with the theme of our class), but his day job and other responsibilities keep him busy.</p>
          <p>Jacob also became the protagonist for a series of <span class="b">storyboards</span> I developed. Storyboarding helped us synthesize what we'd learned about our target users and how we saw our app fitting into our lives. Getting feedback and iterating on our storyboard also helped us hone in on key product requirements, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>The importance of automation to avoid the app becoming a drag</li>
              <li>Delivering just-in-time nudges</li>
              <li>Focusing on small tasks and 'micro-progress' - because they most easily fit into our users' lives, and increased motivation</li>
            </ul></p>

          <h3>Prototyping & user testing</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback on our storyboards, our team brainstormed dozens of directions for our app - and considered multiple platforms (mobile app, chatbot, wearables, web). We eventually chose to <span class="b">prioritize building out the experience of working on a 'micro-goal'</span>, as we felt it was the most essential task users would complete with Spark, and decided mobile app was the best fit for the style of interactions we envisioned. Based on this plan, we sketched out a user task flow that went from getting a notification to the user completing his/her 'micro-goal' for the day.</p>
            <p>This became the basis of our prototype, which we proceeded to test with 5 users. Putting our solution in front of users yielded several valuable insights that shaped our final solution.</p>
